# Testing InteractiveQuestionRenderer Component

## Quick Test Guide

I've created a comprehensive test page for your InteractiveQuestionRenderer component. Here's how to test it:

### 1. Start your React application
```bash
# From the project root
npm start
```

### 2. Navigate to test page
Once logged in (as either teacher or student), go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/test-questions
```

### 3. Test each question type

The test page includes 4 different question types:

#### Question 1: Single Choice
- **Type**: `single_choice` 
- **Question**: "What is the chemical formula for water?"
- **Expected Answer**: A (H2O)
- **Test**: Click option A to see if it highlights correctly

#### Question 2: Multiple Choice  
- **Type**: `multiple_choice`
- **Question**: "Which of the following are noble gases?"
- **Expected Answer**: [0, 2, 4] (Helium, Neon, Argon)
- **Test**: Check multiple boxes - should allow selecting multiple options

#### Question 3: Enhanced Fill-in-the-Blank
- **Type**: `fill_blank` (enhanced format)
- **Template**: Uses `{{placeholder}}` syntax with hints
- **Expected Answer**: ["118", "atomic number", "Mendeleev"]  
- **Test**: 
  - Fill in the blanks within the sentence
  - Click hint buttons (lightbulb icons) to see hints
  - Check progress counter updates

#### Question 4: Legacy Fill-in-the-Blank
- **Type**: `fill_blank` (legacy format)  
- **Question**: Simple blank completion
- **Expected Answer**: ["2HCl"]
- **Test**: Fill in the numbered blank field

### 4. What to check

✅ **Answer Selection**: Each question type accepts input correctly
✅ **State Management**: Current answers display in JSON format
✅ **Validation**: Compare your answers to expected answers  
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Selected options highlight, progress updates
✅ **Hint System**: Lightbulb buttons show/hide hints for enhanced fill-blanks
✅ **Answer Format**: Answers match expected data structures

### 5. Expected Results

- **Single Choice**: Should return single letter (e.g., "A")
- **Multiple Choice**: Should return array of indices (e.g., [0, 2, 4])  
- **Fill Blank**: Should return array of strings (e.g., ["118", "atomic number"])

### 6. Debug Info

The test page shows:
- Current answer for each question
- Expected correct answer  
- Real-time correctness indicator (✅/❌)
- Complete answer object in debug section

### 7. Cleanup

After testing, remove the test route from App.jsx:
```javascript
// Remove this line from both teacher and student routes
<Route path="/test-questions" element={<QuestionRendererTest />} />
```

This test verifies that your InteractiveQuestionRenderer handles all question formats correctly and integrates properly with your backend question system.
